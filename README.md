# HTM-AnomalyDetection

Anomaly detection prototype based on HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory that based on NuPic) and Python 2.7

This prototype is still in the *very early* stage. 

This repository only contains the code snippet and data that used by NuPic to show its functionalities.

I implementeed another HTM scirpt for chemical data that generated from the furnace simulation, as you can see in the figure below.

Currently I only do the experiments on motion data, and the HTM model will detect the anomaly point by using four different sensors' incoming data streams.
