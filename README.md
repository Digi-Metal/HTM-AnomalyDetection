# HTM-AnomalyDetection

Anomaly detection prototype based on HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory that based on NuPic) and Python 2.7

This prototype is still in the *very early* stage. 

This repository only contains the code snippet and data that used by NuPic to show its functionalities.

Currently we only do the experiments on motion data, and the HTM model will detect the anomaly point by using four different sensors' incoming data streams.
