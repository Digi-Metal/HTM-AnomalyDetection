# HTM-AnomalyDetection

Anomaly detection prototype based on HTM (Hierarchical Temporal Memory that based on NuPic) and Python 2.7

This prototype is still in the *very early* stage. 

This repository only contains the code snippet and data that used by NuPic to show its functionalities.

We have integrated HTM backend scripts into Outotec ACT and finally made this workable in an industrial environment!

I implementeed another HTM scirpt for chemical data that generated from the furnace simulation, as you can see in the figure below.

Currently I only do the experiments on motion data, and the HTM model will detect the anomaly point by using four different sensors' incoming data streams.
